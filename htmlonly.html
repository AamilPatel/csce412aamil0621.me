            <h2>The Big Event</h2>
            <p>The Big Event is one of Texas A&M's largest traditions where many students gather together to help out the Bryan/College Station Community. I had the opportunity
                to be a staff member for The Big Event where I went to the houses of residents and ask what they needed help with when the day of the event came. On the day of the event I got to hand
                out tools and prepared for students to return these tools. Being a part of this event put into perspective the impact that this event has on the whole Bryan/College Station 
                community.</p>

            <h2>RunCorpusChristi</h2>
            <p>RunCorpusChristi is an organization co-founded by me along with another group of friends. Through this organization I was able to directly help non-profits affected by the impacts of
                COVID-19. We would hold 5K races to gather money to help non-profits such as Driscoll Children's Hospital and the Ronald McDonald House of Corpus Christi. Through doing this service, I got to experience
                the change that we made to these non-profit organizations by providing the help that we did. We were able to gather the whole community of Corpus Christi to fight for our cause and help these
                organizations in a time of need.</p>

            <h2>SLOPE</h2>
            <p>SLOPE is a sophomore leadership organization at Texas A&M University. A big part of being in this organization is the service aspect. Through being in SLOPE I got to participate in giving back to the
                Bryan/College Station community through events such as Kyle Field Clean Up, Adopt-a-Street, and Health 4 All. Through Kyle Field Clean Up I got to give back to Texas A&M University by cleaning up the field after 
                the game. By participating in cleaning up the street that SLOPE adopted it made me realize that amount of trash that is just on sidewalks and how important it is for us to clean our community.
                Finally, through Health 4 All we got to raise money to provide healthcare to low income individuals. I hope to continue my service through this organization by being a staff member this year now that I am a junior.</p>
